The pony rides have hour-long queues and Mahasu Peak is packed shoulder to shoulder. Beautiful place but timing is everything! Tip: Visit on weekdays or very early morning (before 8 AM). Or try Green Valley instead - similar views, zero crowds! 🏔️ #Kufri #ShimlaTravel #WeekendGetaway #TravelTips #CrowdAlert #HimachalTourism #KufriDiaries #TravelSmart #MountainVibes",

Only locals know about this place. ₹120 for a meal that tastes like home-cooked heaven. The Sidu (wheat bread) is stuffed with local herbs and the Madra (chickpea curry) is creamy perfection.
