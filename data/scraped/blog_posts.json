    "content": "Most tourists stick to Mall Road and Jakhu Temple, but Shimla's true magic lies in its lesser-known corners. Chadwick Falls during monsoon was a revelation – the 3 km trek through deodar forests felt like walking through a nature documentary. Tara Devi sunrise drives, the Green Valley pull-out, Summer Hill pine walks, and artisan stops at Lakkar Bazaar make the perfect slow-travel loop.",
